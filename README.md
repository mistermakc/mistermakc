# Hi there, I'm Max Heilingbrunner üëã

I'm a Master's student in Management and Computer Science, specializing in AI and Machine Learning. My career goal is to establish myself in data science consulting. I have a passion for unraveling data-driven insights and creating models that can be used to make intelligent business decisions.

## üìö Pinned Repositories

Here are some of the projects I have been working on:

1. [api-dashboard](https://github.com/mistermakc/api-dashboard) (Jupyter Notebook) - A dashboard using various APIs to gather and visualize data.
2. [flight-delay-prediction](https://github.com/mistermakc/flight-delay-prediction) (Jupyter Notebook) - Predicting flight delays using historical flight data and machine learning models.
3. [housing-price-prediction](https://github.com/mistermakc/housing-price-prediction) (Jupyter Notebook) - Using regression models to predict housing prices based on various features.
4. [bootstrap-website](https://github.com/mistermakc/bootstrap-website) (HTML) - A website built using the Bootstrap framework.
